## Baseline results
To compare models created during this study, a baseline model was created using only historical monthly data along with the distance to the solar noon feature defined above. Historical data used to create this model was acquired from [here](https://www.saulesgraza.lt/saules-elektrines-generacija) and contained generation data for every month between the year of 2014 to 2019. 

Following images illustrate comparison between prediction results acquired using the baseline model and actual testing values:
